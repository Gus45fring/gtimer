# gtimer
bad cstimer clone with raylib made in an afternoon. saves all the time data to .txt file.
if someone somehow stumbles upon this, please suggest for any kind of feature since i have no idea what to add or report bugs if there are any.
also, i made this whole thing because every time i make a new cstimer session it becomes 4.13333333333... and i have absolutely no idea how to fix it.
