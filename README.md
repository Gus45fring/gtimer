# gtimer
bad cstimer clone with raylib. saves all the time data to .txt file.
if someone somehow stumbles upon this, please suggest for any kind of feature since i have no idea what to add.
also, i made this whole thing because every time i make a new cstimer session it becomes 4.13333333333... and i have absolutely no idea how to fix it.
